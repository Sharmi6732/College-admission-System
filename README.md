# College-admission-System
In general, an admission form consists of various sections and subsections, which are difficult to fill in one go. Often, students leave the site before completing the application form. So, to make it easier for them, ensure that the online application process is simple.

The applicants should be able to apply online, pay the fee, and check their status online. They should also be able to scan and upload documents on the go. In case they drop off for any reason, they may resume the application anytime they want to.

 An online admission system increases the resolution rate. Hence, applicants can see the status of their application in real-time.
